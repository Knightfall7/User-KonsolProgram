# User Management System
This Java program demonstrates a simple user management system. It includes functionalities to add, remove, search, and display users. The program utilizes the UserList class, allowing you to manage a collection of User objects. Here's a brief overview of the functionalities:

Adding Users: Users are added to the system with their ID, first name, last name, email, and address information.

Removing Users: Users can be removed from the system based on their unique ID.

Searching Users: The program allows searching for users based on their ID.

Displaying Users: Users are displayed both before and after sorting, showcasing the sorting functionality.

Usage
The Main class contains the main method, which acts as the entry point for the program. Upon execution, the program performs the following actions:

Initializes a UserList object.
Displays all users in the system.
Adds new users to the system.
Optionally removes a user by ID (commented out in the code).
Optionally searches for a user by ID (commented out in the code).
Sorts users by their first names and displays them before and after sorting.
How to Run
To run the program, execute the Main class. Ensure that you have the necessary Java environment set up on your system.
Note
The code contains commented-out sections (removeUserById(), searchUserById(), sortUsersByName()) that demonstrate additional functionalities. Uncomment and modify these sections to observe different behaviors of the program.

This user management system is a basic example and can be extended for more complex use cases as needed.
